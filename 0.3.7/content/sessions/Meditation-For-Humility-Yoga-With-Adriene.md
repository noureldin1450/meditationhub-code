   Meditation For Humility - 13 Min Practice. 
  Yoga prepares the body for meditation. And for me, the marriage of yoga and
  meditation is the ultimate invitation back to balance.

  The route to inner strength and inner peace is through connecting to a higher
  power. It requires you to explore acceptance and humility. 

  Today, simply do your best to sit with yourself at this stage in your life, on
  this beautiful day.

  NOTE: There is no soothing music in this one. 

  Itâ€™s all you, me, us. 

  Breathe. 

  And listen up.
