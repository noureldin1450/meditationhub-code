  Someone wiser than me said that "taking on the practice of meditation is not
  so much adding something to your life, but rather removing things, obstacles
  to you awareness." 


  This is definitely in line with the point of the video. Myself included, (it
  seems) most of us are constantly trying to find ways to keep ourselves
  operating at a faster, more productive, more focused pace. Like turning up the
  volume on the stereo when we want to hear more clearly, we try and will
  ourselves to focus "harder" as well as amp our brains' ability to focus by
  taking stimulants like coffee. The kind of improvement that meditation
  provides isn't so much like this- instead, it's like hearing more clearly by
  walking into a quieter room. 


  For me, meditation has turned down the loud mind chatter offering up all kinds
  of activities that are different from what I'm trying to do in the moment,
  improving focus in a subtle but effective way. 


  There are several other health benefits, which are outside the scope of this
  video, but I don't much like that meditation is presented as a panacea
  nowadays. It has vast benefits, and I'm sure anyone would benefit from it, but
  I like Dan Harris's non-overpromising remark that it makes him "10% Happier"
