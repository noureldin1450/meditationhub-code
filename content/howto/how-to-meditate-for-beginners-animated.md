  How To Meditate For Beginners! In this video, I'm going to tell you, where to
  meditate, how to meditate, how to stop thinking, how long to meditate for,
  even how long before you start seeing the benefits. 


  Meditation has almost become mainstream by this point, but most people are not
  doing it right. Or rather, they are meditating in a way, that will not make
  the habit stick over a long period of time. My Meditation approach is more
  geared towards the average person, as opposed to the monk who lives in the
  mountains. For example, I understand that a lot of people want to start
  meditating in order to help them sleep, I cover this specific topic in the
  video.
