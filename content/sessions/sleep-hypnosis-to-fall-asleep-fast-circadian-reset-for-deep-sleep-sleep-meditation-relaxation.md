  Welcome to this sleep hypnosis to fall asleep fast and reset your natural
  circadian rhythms before a relaxing, deep sleep. 


  This guided hypnosis experience is a form of sleep meditation with spoken
  suggestions for complete relaxation, accompanied with a soothing soundscape of
  gentle background sleeping music and calm ocean waves.


  This hypnotic session combines aspects of self hypnosis, guided meditation and
  guided visualization to allow a serene sense of floating and drifting into
  into blissfully tranquil, positive dreams.


  Listen along and allow yourself to relax deeply, as you learn how to let go of
  physical tensions in the body, as well as melt away unwanted stresses or
  worries in the mind. Reduce the effects of overthinking, as you turn down any
  excessive noise of mind chatter by more easily floating and drifting into
  blissful sleep at every bedtime. 


  I hope you relax and enjoy this journey towards your positive self empowerment
