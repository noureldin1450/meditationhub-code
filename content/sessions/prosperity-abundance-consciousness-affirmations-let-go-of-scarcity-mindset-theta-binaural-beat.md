  Many people have a scarcity mindset and live in lack without knowing it (read
  more below). This results in a re-creation of situations, patterns, people and
  events that we don´t want in our life. Most people are not aware that they can
  take responsibility and reprogram their mind; awakening to an expanded
  awareness and higher perspective of life; stepping into an abundance mindset
  and prosperity consciousness. Living your AUTHENTIC SELF. Connecting with your
  PURPOSE for being here on Mother Earth. Manifesting life from the core of your
  HEART & SOUL. 


  This meditation/affirmation audio is created with the intention to help you
  re-program your subconscious mind with new EMPOWERING beliefs that align you
  with the Abundant Source Energy. 


  When you are aligned with Source/Higher Self - you will still have challenges
  to face, but your abundance mindset is an empowering vibration. And you take
  full responsibility for how you respond to it, instead of feeling powerless
  and blaming others. Life is a school for the most courageous Souls. You chose
  to be here for a reason. Challenges serve YOU the golden opportunity to learn,
  grow and SHINE YOUR LIGHT - Strong and Bright. 


  “Everything that happens, happens for you.” - The Universe



  I call this series 'Higher Self Affirmations' because it fits the vibe and
  depth of the affirmations - and when I write them it feels like I am being
  'coached' by my Higher Mind.

  WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SCARCITY AND ABUNDANCE MINDSET


  Most people associate abundance with money or material goods. One can be
  abundant in money and material goods - that´s one aspect of it, but what about
  having an abundance of love, joy, freedom, peace, courage, passion,
  creativity, knowledge and health? Isn´t that the real wealth and prosperity?
  Your life may already be much more abundant than you realize. It depends on
  whether you focus on what you do have, or on what you don´t have.
