dis: "\nToday, we're doing a relaxing meditation. This is a Chandra Bhedana pranayama to connect with our lunar, yin, feminine side and calm down.  In this class, we're going to tap into this feminine, cooling energy in the body in order to help you relax and calm down.\n\U0001F4D8 FREE BEGINNER YOGA GUIDE https://www.brettlarkin.com/masterthe...\n\nIf you're a type-a like me or a busy mom who's getting a lot done or you just want to slow a little bit, you know, you need to cal down and ground and relax. This is the meditation for you. \n\nDo you ever feel like you just want to slow down, find more calm, and relax? \U0001F60C I know I do! If you're Type A, like me, it can be even more of a challenge to get into that cozy, zen state. But that's why I love meditation (and especially pranayama, yogic breathing) so much. I like to think of pranayama as \"yoga for the mind.\" And in this class, we do my FAV pranayama to relax and calm down: Chandra Bhedana!\n\n\U0001F48E 7 DAY CHAKRA CHALLENGE https://www.brettlarkin.com/chakra\n✨ ONLINE YOGA TEACHER TRAINING https://www.brettlarkin.com/online-yo...\n\U0001F4AA Go Deeper with Your Yoga Practice  https://www.brettlarkin.com/uplifted/\n\nCheckout My Brett Larkin Yoga Marathon Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBqQu...\nMore Meditation in this Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPCRb...\n\n\U0001F3B5by Good Vibes Collective available on Spotify and Apple Music: \nhttps://open.spotify.com/artist/2N4tX...\n\nFrom my ❤️ to yours, Namaste..
