  A short and powerful visualization meditation for detaching from negativity
  accumulated from thoughts, people, events and surroundings. Rounding off the
  session with I AM Affirmations. We live in intense times and it is now more
  important than ever to take care of your energy. Life is life. We face stuff.
  Learn from - and heal any challenge that you may be facing - by connecting to
  your Heart, your Soul, and Universal Wisdom; stepping into your INNER POWER
  and LIGHT.
