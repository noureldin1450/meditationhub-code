  THE HONEST GUYS

  We write and create high quality Guided Meditations videos that we strive to
  make freely viewable on YouTube. We have been creating these meditations since
  2009. 

  The meditations were begun with one purpose: simply to try and help people.
  Every meditation is produced with genuine care and love for those people who
  use them, because we too have needed the kind of help our meditations are
  trying to offer others.

  Our ethos is to be as all-inclusive and as neutral as possible. We have no
  religious or other affiliations and try to keep most of our meditations
  suitable for everyone. We always welcome comments, feedback & suggestions and
  actively engage with our subscribers via our Facebook page.
