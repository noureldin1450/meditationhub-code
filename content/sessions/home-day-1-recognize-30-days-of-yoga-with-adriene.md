  Yoga provides us the tools for getting to know who we really are. This journey
  is about reuniting with your self through regular practice. Through the
  process of getting to know who you really are, you will find that you need not
  prioritize the where, or the what, as much. 


  You just have to be brave enough to look inside and recognize who it is you
  see.


  The opportunity is to be who you are and recognize where you are, today.  


  The choice is to do it honestly and with kindness. 


  In our first practice, we apply this to asana and open up to the postures
  serving as opportunities to make discoveries. 


  We ease in with a powerful practice of observation and recognition. 


  This is your longest class of the series, one in which sets the tone. 


  Let me know how it goes for you in the comment section down below. 


  Share your experience with #ywaHOME


  From my home to yours, 


  Namaste.
