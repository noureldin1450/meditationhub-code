dis: "\nA beautiful 20 minute guided meditation to connect with your higher self. This is perfect for beginners who need guidance through a beautiful story into the higher self.\n\n\U0001F4D8MASTER THE BASICS FREE PDF https://www.brettlarkin.com/masterthe...\n\U0001F48E7 DAY CHAKRA CHALLENGE https://www.brettlarkin.com/chakra\n✨ONLINE YOGA TEACHER TRAINING https://www.brettlarkin.com/online-yo...\n\nI absolutely love this guided meditation. It feels somewhat magical and reminds me of the guided meditations I used to do when I was a kid at summer camp (although I didn't know that's what I was doing!). Now, I use the same magical storytelling to walk you through a beautiful garden into your inner meditative space. By walking you into yourself, this meditation helps you connect with your higher self, leaving you feeling refreshed and inspired for the rest of the day. It's hard to believe it's only 20 minutes!\n\nCalming Guided Kundalini Heart Chakra Meditation: https://youtu.be/XlE5fvpJNss\nMorning Sun Salutations: Surya Namaskar A & B For Beginners: https://youtu.be/OCAnb1RkXvE\n\nFrom my ❤️ to yours, Namaste..
